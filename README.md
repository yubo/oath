# goathtool README

## Synopsis

goathtool attempts reproduces the functionality of nongnu.org's oathtool
<http://www.nongnu.org/oath-toolkit/man-oathtool.html>. How incompletely is to
be determined. The intent is to implement the functionality the primary author
uses most and then -- as time or PRs occur -- to fill in more of the features.
The author also intends to differ in implementation of defaults and invocation.

goathtool will only implement the short flags as the author intends to forgo 3rd
party libraries.

## Description
